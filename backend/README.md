# üåê Data Analyst Agent ‚Äì Web Scraping & QnA with LLM + DuckDB

A **FastAPI backend** for dynamically analyzing web content. This project scrapes web pages, builds vector embeddings for semantic search, and answers user questions using **OpenRouter LLMs**. It also generates visualizations for numeric data, returning all results in structured **JSON responses**, including base64-encoded images.

Perfect for researchers, analysts, and developers who need to **interact with web data intelligently**.

## ‚ú® Features

- **üåêWeb Scraping**

  - Extracts clean text and structured tables from any public URL.
  - Ignores irrelevant elements like `<script>`, `<style>`, `<img>`, `<svg>`, and `<i>`.

- **üóÑÔ∏èDuckDB Integration**

  - Stores extracted structured data (tables, text chunks) and generated embeddings for semantic search
  - Enables fast analytical queries without requiring external databases
  - Embeddings allow the LLM to efficiently retrieve relevant context for each question

- **üß† LLM Integration (OpenRouter)**

  - Answers natural language questions based on scraped content.
  - Supports dynamic queries on both text and tabular data.

- **üìä Automatic Visualization**

  - Detects numeric queries and generates scatterplots automatically.
  - Returns images encoded in base64 for seamless frontend display.

- **üåç CORS & Frontend Ready**
  - Supports cross-origin requests for frameworks like React, Next.js, or Vue.

## Example Questions.txt file

```
Scrape the list of highest grossing films from Wikipedia. It is at the URL:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_highest-grossing_films

Answer the following questions and respond with a JSON array of strings containing the answer.

1. How many $2 bn movies were released before 2000?
2. Which is the earliest film that grossed over $1.5 bn?
3. What's the correlation between the Rank and Peak?
4. Draw a scatterplot of Rank and Peak along with a dotted red regression line through it.
   Return as a base-64 encoded data URI, `"data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KG..."` under 100,000 bytes.

```
